<p>As a software engineer I usually find myself deciding whether to use existing tools or develop them on my own and to what extent. I have made my own checklist in order to help me to take those decisions.<br><br />
  <br></p>
<h3>Best option: use an existing tool. These are some of the benefits versus developing your own tool</h3>
<p>    <input type="checkbox"> Re-writing code that exists is wasted effort and makes the project takes longer than is necessary.<br><br />
    <input type="checkbox"> Your code is more likely to have more bugs/unforeseen issues than general widely used tools because those tools have been tested and patched multiple times. It's hard and time-consuming encountering the corner-cases by yourself.<br><br />
    <input type="checkbox"> Your code is more likely to miss features.<br><br />
    <input type="checkbox"> Your code has probably worse documentation.<br><br />
    <input type="checkbox"> Your code probably will not have community support (e.g. on stackoverflow, github, linkedin, ...).<br><br />
    <input type="checkbox"> Your code has to be maintained even when no new features are added (e.g. upgrading and adapting to a new version of a library).<br><br />
    <input type="checkbox"> If you use a well known tool, you may hire developers that had already used it.<br><br />
    <input type="checkbox"> Studying and truly understanding good existing solutions is a great way to learn from others and  become a better developer.<br><br />
    <br></p>
<h3>Second best option: extend an existing tool</h3>
<p>    <input type="checkbox"> You could choose a widely used tool and extend it for adapting to your requirements.<br><br />
    <input type="checkbox"> You may share your extension (e.g. creating a pull request) and take advantage of the community (e.g. through bug reporting and bug fixing ).<br><br />
    <input type="checkbox"> You could be benefiting from the eventual improvements of the tool.<br><br />
    <br></p>
<h3>Third option: rethink your requirements</h3>
<p>    <input type="checkbox"> Perhaps you have the same issue than others but you intend to solve it in a weird way. Try to rethink your requirements in a more standard manner.<br><br />
    <input type="checkbox"> Software world is subject to trends. If you follow them you will have the software community with you: <span>"</span><i>Never be wrong alone, if you are to be wrong, better be wrong with most everyone else</i><span>"</span><br />
    <br></p>
<h3>Nevertheless create your own software if ...</h3>
<p>    <input type="checkbox"> It's a part of the core business: <span>"</span><i>It's ok to reinvent the wheel when you're a wheel manufacturer</i><span>"</span>.<br><br />
    <input type="checkbox"> Your requirements are specific and inflexible, hence you need to have a complete control with your own solution.<br><br />
    <input type="checkbox"> There is no tool that fits the requirements or that can be extended (with a proportional cost)<br />
    in order to satisfy them.<br><br />
    <input type="checkbox"> Existing tools are black boxes, are bad documented, expensive or with a poor community support.<br></p>
<p>So after all, is your company a <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WheelFactory">wheel factory</a>?</p>
