I have been working developing software for the last 15 years. I am curious and love experimenting with new technologies and paradigms like cloud computing, big data, machine learning, reactive programming or continuous deployment.

I feel highly productive working in cross-functional and autonomous teams that follow the devops and agile principles. Likewise I prefer paradigms that fit well with those principles like microservice and serverless architectures.
